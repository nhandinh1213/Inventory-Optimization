# Inventory-Optimization
This project focus on enhance Inventory Performance from purchase to sales activities including inventory analysis, sales demand forecasting, purchase analysis and carrying cost analysis
## Business problems
Retail enterprises face a critical challenge in optimizing inventory ordering decisions to ensure product availability while minimizing storage costs. Ineffective inventory management can lead to increased stockouts, resulting in lost sales and diminished customer loyalty, or excess inventory, which incurs higher holding costs and potential obsolescence. The complexity is further intensified by the need to accurately forecast demand using diverse data sources and adapt to real-time market fluctuations. Retailers must balance reorder points, lead times, and Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) to achieve cost efficiency and customer satisfaction. Advanced forecasting techniques and collaborative supply chain strategies are essential to address these challenges and optimize the inventory ordering process.
## Business Objective
### General Objective
Enhance inventory management in a retail wine and spirits context by applying advanced data analysis to optimize inventory control and extract insights from sales and procurement data.
### Specific Objectives:
- Streamline inventory levels to minimize excess stock and reduce holding costs, improving cash flow. 
- Enhance forecast accuracy to align inventory with sales trends, reducing stockouts and overstock situations.
- Optimize safety stock levels to prevent stockouts while maintaining cost-effective inventory.
- Improve purchasing processes to reduce costs and enhance procurement efficiency, ensuring timely replenishment.
## Business questions
1. What are the key items in our inventory that contribute most significantly to the overall value, and how can we prioritize their management?
2. How do carrying costs impact our total inventory expenses, and what strategies can we implement to minimize these costs?
3. What seasonal trends and external factors significantly influence our demand, and how should these be accounted for in our inventory strategy?
4. What is the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) for our key products, and how does this align with our purchasing strategy?
5. How do lead times from suppliers affect our overall inventory management, and what measures can we take to reduce these lead times?
6. How can we adjust our safety stock levels in response to changes in market conditions or supplier reliability?
7. At what inventory level should we trigger a reorder, and how can we ensure timely replenishment to avoid stockouts?
